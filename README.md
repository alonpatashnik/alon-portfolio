# alon-portfolio

This project is a sample portfolio for myself, Alon Patashnik.
It contains a header with a nav bar, a banner and a main section that includes 3 flexboxes (an about me section, a work samples section, and a contact me section)

I realize this is not best practice, but I started working on this in a practice folder and them moved my files into my cloned folder then commited that work. I know this isn't the correct way to do it but I jsut wanted you to be aware of the process.
